## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Orykz/play-js-snake.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd play-js-snake
    ```
3.  **Run from a local server:**
    Since this project uses JavaScript modules, you need to serve the files from a local web server. The easiest way is to use the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension in Visual Studio Code. Simply right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
